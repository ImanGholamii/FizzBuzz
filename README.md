# FizzBuzz
## Mini Project 01 _ Mini Game


Welcome to FizzBuzz! This is the first and initial version of the game, written entirely by myself. I know it could be better but now(in this version) thats it.

## Introduction
FizzBuzz is a classic programming exercise often used in interviews. The rules are simple: players take turns counting up from 1, replacing any number divisible by 3 with "Fizz", any number divisible by 5 with "Buzz", and any number divisible by both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz".

## How to Play
To play FizzBuzz:
1. Run the Python script provided in this repository. You are P1.
2. Follow the prompts to input your choice for each number.
3. If your number is divisible by 3, type "Fizz". If it's divisible by 5, type "Buzz". If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, type "FizzBuzz".
4. The game will automatically determine if your choice matches the FizzBuzz rules and provide feedback accordingly.
